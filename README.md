# phonebook
a practice based on bash
the commands all begin with 'phonebook'
phonebook new "NAME" "PHONENUMBER" :include a new name and a new phone number in forms of XXX-XXX-XXXX
phonebook list : to list all information in phonebook.log ,if there is nothing ,it will says "phonebook is empty"
phonebook remove "NAME" :remove one's information ,if the man is unknown ,nothing happened
phonebook clear : a dangerous command which can clear phonebool all
phonebook lookup "NAME" : list one's name and phonenumber,no matter if there are so many same names

above all,it is a PHONEBOOK,welcome to commit advice ,thank you.
